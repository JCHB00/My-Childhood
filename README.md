# My-Childhood
A game was disigned in my 16 years old.(Now it is false and stop updated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


在我十六嵗時設計的游戲，(現在已經放棄!!!)

僅作記錄。

游戲一部分基於 DND規則 + COC 内容 + Elone(極度冷門的日本jrpg游戲)

基本由excel 實現。【P.S. 當時沒有學會編程】


A game I designed when I was sixteen (now abandoned!!!)

For records only.

Part of the game is based on DND rules + COC content + Elone (extremely unpopular Japanese jrpg game)

Basically implemented by excel. [P.S. I didn’t learn programming at that time]
